## Goal

Can I improve the LB score simply by scaling the data?

## Motivation

This is the last idea I have: to take GPT4 and use to to scale the training data.

## Development

I'm going to divide the generation process into two steps:

1. Given prompt samples create new prompts
2. With those prompts create new training samples

## Results

## Conclusion

## Next steps
