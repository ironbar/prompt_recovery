# Iteration 18. Generate data with Gemma

_15-04-2024_

## Goal

So far I have generated all my data with GPT4, let's try to rewrite the texts using Gemma and train on that data.

## Motivation

I had the belief that generating data with GPT4 would result on a better model, but maybe I was wrong.

## Conclusion

I have cancelled the iteration because generation was painfully slow and the generated text did not look good.

## Next steps

Focus on preparing the last submissions.
