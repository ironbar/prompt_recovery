# Data Understanding

## Collect initial data

<!---Acquire the data (or access to the data) listed in the project resources.
This initial collection includes data loading, if necessary for data understanding.
For example, if you use a specific tool for data understanding, it makes perfect
sense to load your data into this tool. This effort possibly leads to initial data
preparation steps.
List the dataset(s) acquired, together with their locations, the methods used to
acquire them, and any problems encountered. Record problems encountered and any
resolutions achieved. This will aid with future replication of this project or
with the execution of similar future projects.

>	Indeed it's a pain downloading huge files. Especially when there are connection issues. I used "wget" to download the dataset with an option "-c" for resuming capability in case the download fails.  You would need to save the cookies in the page using a chrome extension Chrome Extension  save the cookies as cookies.txt from the extension  Then you can download the files by using the following command

	wget -c -x --load-cookies cookies.txt https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection/data?train_wkt.csv.zip

No official data is provided for this challenge.

## External data

<!--- It is allowed in this challenge? If so write it here ideas of how to find
it and if people have already posted it on the forum describe it. --->

On this [post](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-prompt-recovery/discussion/481811) there is a collection of generated data.

Particularly interesting is a [dataset created by the host](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-prompt-recovery/discussion/480288) for testing and accidentally leaked. He says
it is very different from the hidden one.
